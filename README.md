Hi Alex
 Please help.
I have a file at  https://github.com/Gasar-Iyali/lpmj.git.
The file is sqltest.php

 When I try to run the file sqltest.php in my browser I get this error message.
 Parse error: syntax error, unexpected end of file in C:\Users\ZACK AMATA\Documents\xampp\htdocs\lpmj\sqltest.php on line 86
 
 What is it that I am doing wrong or not doing? How can I debug this file/program so that it runs well in the browser?
I would really appreciate it if you could help me so that the file can function properly.

Thank you for your help
